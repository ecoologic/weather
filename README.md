## The Challenge

Trend Micro Frontend Challenge, Front-end focused project.

Only for candidates who have demonstrated a history of working with AWS services particularly Lambda and other serverless services.

1. Create a React application with the tooling and the design system of your choice
2. Create a simple form that takes a location as an input parameter.
3. Integrate with the MetaWeather API to find the entered location: if there are many results for the search text entered, the user may have to select the desired location.

The API does not support CORS, so you will need to have a very simple mechanism in place to bypass the issue

4.  Display the weather forecast for the next four days of the given location. Use the image assets provided by the documentation and display the following information:

        General description of the weather
        Minimum and maximum temperature
        Wind speed

5.  Add tests to your application
6.  Ensure that the application outputs production-ready artifacts
    Bonus: Use the geolocation browser API in order to find the userâ€™s location, pre-populate the form and display the weather forecast when the page has loaded

Notes:

    Create a GitHub repository and keep a history of your work. Once done, please send us a link to your repository.
    The goal is to demonstrate your technical capabilities, so the quality of the steps is more important than the number of steps you complete.
    You can request a review before your work is complete. We normally respond to your code review requests within 24 hours.
    Platform: Node.js 14.x
    Language: JavaScript/ES6 or TypeScript
    Use Jest or similar frameworks for unit testing
    Use Prettier to format your code
    Use ESLint to ensure code quality
    Your work will be scored on problem break-down, functionality (accuracy and precision), performance, scalability, code readability, coding best practices, software design, and documentation.
